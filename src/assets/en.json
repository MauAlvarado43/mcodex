            "p1": "Hello, my name is Mauricio Alvarado LÃ³pez, I am 19 years old and I was born in Mexico City. I studied the Programming Technician career during high school and I am currently studying Articicial Intelligence Engineering at ESCOM. I am a full stack developer specialized in JavaScript. I am passionate, dedicated and committed to my work, always giving my best. Personally, I consider myself a responsible and organized person, fulfilling my duty in a timely manner.",
            "p2": "Most of the knowledge that I have I have acquired in a self-taught way since I always try to learn something new. The last thing I want to do is stay behind in a field as changeable as this is. That is precisely why my main goal is to become an excellent developer.",
            "p3": "This is McodeX, a personal project where I plan to form my own work environment, showing the projects that I have been carried out and in turn, contributing the knowledge that I have acquired so that more people know how exciting the world of programming is."
